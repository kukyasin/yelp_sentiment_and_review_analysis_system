# Yelp Sentiment & Review Analysis System (YSRAS)
```
## Project Overview
The Yelp Sentiment & Review Analysis System (YSRAS) is a comprehensive project designed to analyze Yelp reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods. This project goes beyond simply classifying user comments as positive, negative, or neutral, incorporating fine-grained sentiment analysis, topic modeling, predictions, and visualizations.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Build models to determine the emotional states in Yelp reviews.
2. **Word Distribution and Topic Modeling**: Identify frequently used words and analyze topics based on business types.
3. **Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis**: Distinguish emotional states in more detail (e.g., anger, happiness, sadness).
4. **Star Rating Prediction Models**: Develop regression models to predict star ratings based on reviews.
5. **Geographical Data Analysis and Visualization**: Visualize the geographical distribution of Yelp businesses.
6. **Recommendation System Development**: Create systems that suggest new businesses based on user preferences.
7. **Anomaly Detection**: Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify fake reviews.
8. **Time Series Analysis**: Examine the changes in business star ratings over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and analyses.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For deep learning methods.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **Folium / Geopandas**: For geographic visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Download and install **Python 3.7+**.
2. Navigate to this project directory and run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To utilize different components of the project, follow these steps:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` file to analyze the sentiment of the reviews.
2. **Topic Modeling**: Use the `topic_modeling.py` file to explore word distributions and topics.
3. **Star Rating Prediction Models**: Use the `star_prediction.py` file to make predictions of star ratings from the reviews.
4. **Geographic Visualization**: Use `geo_analysis.py` to visualize the geographic distribution of Yelp businesses.
